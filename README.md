Group course project for DSA at UFL. Built a program to calculate the shortest route between 
cities on a map of North America. Implemented Dijkstra'sand Bellman Ford shortest path algorithms 
to calculate paths and compared performances. Included a feature to calculate number of charges for 
EV car and number of tanks for gasoline powered car necessary for the trip.
