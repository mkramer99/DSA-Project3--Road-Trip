# DSA-Project3--Road-Trip

Group course project for DSA at UFL. Built a program to calculate the shortest route between 
cities on a map of North America. Implemented Dijkstra'sand Bellman Ford shortest path algorithms 
to calculate paths and compared performances. The road network was pulled from a public database
and an adjacency list was created for the program. Included a feature to calculate number of charges 
for EV car and number of tanks for gasoline powered car necessary for the trip.
